# Car Price Exploration and Prediction

## Dataset

This data set includes information about cars and their prices. This notebook is going to explore the dataset to find out insights about the data and use machine learning algorithms to perform prediction on the prices.. The dataset contains 13 columns. There is name column, selling_price column, fuel, company location.... You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho). For the prediction, we are going to be using Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression algorithms. 

## The Objectives of this project to:
* Perform data wrangling
* Analyze and visualize insights about salaries in the data science field
* Report the insights and visulaization
* Perform predictions using machine learning algorithms
